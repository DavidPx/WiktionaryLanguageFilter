[Wiktionary](http://wiktionary.org) is an awesome resource for when learning a language.  

However when a given word is used in multiple languages, such as [sollen](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sollen), it can be a annoying to navigate to your target language all the time.

This simple Chrome extension adds "#MyLanguage" to Wiktionary URLs in order that your browser will always jump to your language.
