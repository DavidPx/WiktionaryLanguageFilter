# WiktionaryLanguageFilter
[Wiktionary](http://wiktionary.org) is an awesome resource for when learning a language.  

However when a given word is used in multiple languages, such as [sollen](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sollen), it can be a annoying to navigate to your target language all the time.

This Chrome extension has two ways to solve this problem:

* It will automatically scroll your browser to your preferred language
* It will remove all content not related to to one or more preferred languages

The choice is up to you and how you prefer to use Wiktionary.

## Development

* Set your Chrome Extensions page to Developer Mode
